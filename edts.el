;;; Commentary:

;; The Erlang Development Tool Suite (EDTS) is a package of useful development
;; tools for working with the Erlang programming language in Emacs. It bundles a
;; number of useful external packages, together with specialized Erlang plugins for
;; them, and its own features to create a complete and efficient development
;; environment that is easy to set up.

;; Currently EDTS provides:
;; - A snazzy erlang shell wrapper with syntax highlighting and auto-completion.
;; - In-buffer flymake-like compilation
;; - In-buffer xref checks
;; - Dialyzer integration
;; - Rudimentary project support
;; - Code navigation.
;; - Auto-completion, using auto-complete-mode
;; - Auto-highlighting, using auto-highlight-mode
;; - Convenient access to Erlang documentation
;; - In-buffer running of unit tests
;; - A usable interface to the erlang debugger

;; For more information, hit `M-x describe-minor-mode RET edts-mode RET`.
